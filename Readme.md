It's a simple TodoApp which is user protected and data is all stored.
For the frontend, I am using React and Redux.
For the backend, I am using Ruby on Rails API.
I am using Devise JWT for authentication

Please note the names are bit strange here.. 

## test_components refers to Back End Rails API.
## my-app refers to Front End React app.
